Javascript was also fascinating because i could make special functions to make videos mute and unmute with a button while keeping the interface clean. i also learned a lot of other uses for the javascript functions, such as an age slider for a form that would email the information to a specific email address.

              <td><h2>i enjoyed learning HTML, CSS, javascript, and some of the basics of python along the way. It was interesting to know how everything fits together like puzzle pieces, with CSS communicating with HTML and HTML communicating with javascript. The CSS grid was handy for this portfolio because it helped me organize and separate my text from each other. It was also helpful to learn how fonts worked with CSS to make my page look less bland.
